      <h3>Traceability</h3>
      <p>
        The development of a web application aimed at visualizing manufacturing operations data.
        The application features dynamic Gantt charts representing each operation and offers various
        data perspectives, including views by personnel, workplace, or manufacturing order.
        Additionally, it incorporates a logistical view mapping the progression of orders.

        The primary objective of this application is to enhance productivity by providing comprehensive
        measurements and identifying bottlenecks within the manufacturing process. Notably, a significant
        portion of the project involved rectifying corrupted data within the database to ensure accurate visualization.

        Built with a .NET backend and Angular frontend, the application boasts a robust architecture and a user-friendly interface.
