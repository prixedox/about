      <h3>Traceability</h3>
      <p>
        The development of a web application aimed at visualizing data of manufacturing operations.
        The application features gantt charts representing each operation and offers various
        data perspectives, including views by personnel, workplace, machine, or manufacturing order.
        Also it contains a map of logistical view of the order progression.

        The primary objective of this application is to enhance productivity by providing comprehensive
        measurements and identifying bottlenecks within the manufacturing process. Notably, a significant
        portion of the project involved cleaning the corrupted data within the database to ensure accurate visualization.

        Built with a .NET backend and Angular frontend, the application boasts a robust architecture and a user-friendly interface.
